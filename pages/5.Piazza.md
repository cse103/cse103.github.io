If you don't have an account on Piazza, please contact one of the TAs
(see  [Coordinates](/Coordinates) )

In general, we recommend that you post your questions and
comments for the whole class to see, and without hiding your
identity. However, when you think that the situation calls for more
privacy, you can post your question anonymously. 

You can also use Piazza to send emai to specific students/TAs or
instructor. However, please do so only in situations where there is a
clear need that other students don't know. Otherise, we might just
ignore your message.
