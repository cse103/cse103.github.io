Discussions are an important part of the edX course. Discussions will be organized by topic, which will help you find the answer to your question if somebody has already posted it.

Please minimize your use of direct email to the staff. We will create a wide array of topics, from questions regarding the videos and the HW, to topics for the week, to general comments and requests.
