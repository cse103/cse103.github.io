### Course administration

* All students whose email is on the class list or the waiting list
  should have received an email inviting them to join the course edX
  web site. If you have not recieved such an email.
* Videos and HW will be posted on [edx-edge](https://edge.edx.org/courses/UCSD/CSE103/Introduction_to_Probability_and_Statistics/course/)
* In addition to Lectures, Each of the 4 TAs will hold a one hour discussion and a two hours of office times (see calendar for details).

### Waiting List

If you are on the waiting list for the class. I recommend that you
that you fully participate in the class (attend lectures and do HW)
for the first two weeks of the quarter. Registered students can drop
out of the course within that time period with no consequene, and
students whose name is in the waiting list will be able to register. HW assignments are open for only one week so you will not be
able to make them up later.

### Will I get in? 

The instructors do not have information about the number of waiting list students that are likely to get into the class. For all such queries please email csestudents@eng.ucsd.edu.
