## Piazza
We will use [Piazza](http:piazza.com/ucsd/fall2018/cse103/home) for both administrative and educational matters. You can sign up to to this piazza site through [this link](http:piazza.com/ucsd/fall2018/cse103).

## Online materials
Videos, Problem sets and Programming assignments will be provided on a weekly basis through the [Class edX.edge](https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSD+CSE103_2018+2018_fall/course/) website. Each student should receive an email with a link to their account. If you did not receive such an email please contact the teaching staff through Piazza.
