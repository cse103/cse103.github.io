## CSE 103. A Practical Introduction to Probability and Statistics ##

Combinatorics. Distributions over discrete and continuous
domains. Conditional probability and Independence. Bayesian
inference. Random variables, expectation, mean, variance and
covariance. Binomial and Poisson distributions. Markov and Chebyshev's
inequalities. Central limit theorem. Hypothesis testing. Regression.

CSE 103 is not duplicate credit for ECE 109, Econ 120A, or Math 183.

**Prerequisites:** 
* Math 20A-B and (Math 184A or CSE 21 or Math 154);
* Python, jupyter notebooks.

## Piazza
We will use [Piazza](http:piazza.com/ucsd/fall2018/cse103/home) for both administrative and educational matters. You can sign up to to this piazza site through [this link](http:piazza.com/ucsd/fall2018/cse103).

## Online materials
Videos, Quizes, Problem sets and Programming assignments will be provided on a weekly basis through the [Class edX.edge](https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSD+CSE103_2018+2018_fall/course/) website. Each student should receive an email with a link to their account. If you did not receive such an email please contact the teaching staff through Piazza.

## Notebooks and programming assignments
In this course we use Jupyter notebooks both as examples during the
videos and the lectures and as Programming Assignments. Programming
assignments would be evaluated by answering questions on the edX web site.

### Installing Jupyter Notebooks
Directions for installing Jupyter notebooks on different platforms are available from DSE200 here: https://mas-dse.github.io/startup/

## Grading ##
The final number grade will be on the scale of 0-100. 
* 20 points for the average of 9 quizes. Lowest grade quiz will be dropped from the average.
* 30 points for the average of 8 problem sets. Lowest grade problem set will
  be dropped from the average.
* 20 points for the average 0f 10 Programming Assignements. Lowest
  grade PA will be dropped from the average.
* 30 points Final Exam

* There will be no Midterms.
