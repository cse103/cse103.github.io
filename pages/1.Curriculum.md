## CSE 103. A Practical Introduction to Probability and Statistics ##

Combinatorics. Distributions over discrete and continuous
domains. Conditional probability and Independence. Bayesian
inference. Random variables, expectation, mean, variance and
covariance. Binomial and Poisson distributions. Markov and Chebyshev's
inequalities. Central limit theorem. Hypothesis testing. Learning
classifiers.

CSE 103 is not duplicate credit for ECE 109, Econ 120A, or Math 183. 

**Prerequisites:** Math 20A and Math 20B.

## Plan of classes ##

* **Week1:** Introduction and motivation. Sets. (Chapters 1,2)
* **Week2:** Finite uniform probability spaces, basic combinatorics. (Chapters 3,4)
* **Week3:** Poker problems, general probability spaces, Converging/diverging series, CDFs   (chapters 4.5, 5)
* **Week4:** Conditional probabilities, Bayes, Monti Hall, Game
    theory, Conditional Poker, (chapter 6)
* **Week5:** Random variablesExpectation and variance, expectations that are infinite or undefined. (Chapter 7)
* **Week6:**  Covariance, correlation coefficient and
    independence. Exponential and poisson distributions (Chapter 8)
* **Week7:** Samping, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing
    (Chapter 9)
* **Week8:** Randomized Algorithms 1 (Chapter 10.1 - 10.4)
* **Week9:** Randomized Algorithm 2 (10.5 - 10.7)
* **Week10:**  Review.

## Grading ##

The final number grade will be an average:

* 60% Grades on WebWork homework. The lowest 2 grades will be dropped.
* 40% Final Exam
* There will be no Midterms.

Students that are on the waiting list are expected to do the
assignments for the class until the time that they know they will not
be able to join the class. It will not be possible for such students
to do the assignments later.
